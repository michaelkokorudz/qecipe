        "instructions": "To prepare your meat, put the escalopes on to a chopping board, put a piece of wax paper on top and bat the meat with the bottom of a saucepan to flatten in a little - you want to get it to about 1/4 inch thick.\n\nTo breadcrumb your meat, get yourself four large plates and lay them out in a line in the front of you. From left to right, you want to have your slat and pepper in one, flour in the second, beaten egg in the third and your fine breadcrumbs in the fourth. It is very simple...season the pieces of meat and dip them into the flour, shaking off any excess, then put them into the egg, dripping off any excess, and into the breadcrumbs, patting them over both sides and pressing down quite firmly. Gently shake off any excess and put the meat on a board or clean plate ready to be cooked.\n\nHeat a heavy frying pan, add a couple of good glugs of olive oil and, when it is good and hot, put both pieces of pork into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes or so, then carefully start to shake and agitate the pan to cover them in the hot oil. Turn the pork over and continue to cook for a couple of minutes until both sides are crisp and golden brown. Remove to a tray line with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Put a schnitzel on to each of your serving plates. Put a little pile of cornichon matchsticks and some watercress leaves on top and serve with a big lob of apple sauce, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.",

Season with salt and as much of the remaining spice blend as youd like, depending on how spicy youd like the dish to be. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are cooked to your desired degree of doneness.

Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes.\n\nNotes:\n\n* A little cream (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. \n\n* For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. \n\n* The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

Add in eggs and yolks pulsing a couple times again and scrape down to ensure all is smooth and uniform. With machine running, pour in melted Godiva Chocolate in a steady stream until all in, and finish by pulsing in the cr\u00e8me fraiche. Pour batter into a 10\" x 10\" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.\n\nOnce the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",

With the mixer running, add the oil and continue mixing until the mixture looks sandy, about 30 seconds more.\r\n\r\nIn a large measuring cup, combine the vanilla with the milk and coffee(or water), and add all at once to the dry ingredients. Mix for 1 minute at low speed, stop and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then mix for 30 seconds more.\r\n\r\nAdd the eggs one at a time, beating well at medium-high speed between additions.\r\n\r\nScrape the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl, and mix for 30 seconds more. The batter will be thin.\r\n\r\nTransfer the batter to the prepared pan(s) of your choice. Smooth out the tops of the layers with an offset spatula.\r\n\r\nBake for 34 minutes for a 9\" x 13\" pan, 28 to 30 minutes for 9\" layers, and 24 to 26 minutes for 8\" layers. (Try 16-18 minutes for cupcakes?)\r\n\r\nThe cake is done when the top springs back when very lightly touched in the center, and the edges just begin to pull away from the edge of the pan. A cake tester inserted in the center will come out clean.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSift or sieve the cocoa, 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar and espresso powder, if youre using it, into a bowl.\r\n\r\nBring the cream to a simmer on the stove or in the microwave, and whisk into the cocoa mixture. At first the mixture will look grainy; continue whisking for a minute. Youll see the lumps disappear as the sugar dissolves and the cocoa hydrates. Set aside to cool to room temperature.\r\n\r\nPlace the butter, salt, and 2 cups sifted or sieved confectioners sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla.\r\n\r\nWith the mixer running on low speed, add the cocoa mixture a spoonful at a time until its all incorporated. Scrape the bowl, then beat at medium speed for one minute more.

When the pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate, add just 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat pan.\r\n\r\n2 Add the shrimp, quickly spreading out around the cooking surface area so that they are not overlapping. Let fry, untouched for 30 seconds. Flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the pan onto a plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\r\n\r\n3 Turn the heat to medium, let the pan heat up again. Add the eggs, stirring in a quick motion to break up and scramble the eggs. When the eggs are almost cooked through (they should still be slightly runny in the middle), dish out of the pan into the same plate as the cooked shrimp.\r\n\r\n4 Use paper towels to wipe the same wok or saut\u00e9 pan clean and return to high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling to coat. When the oil is very hot, add the green onions and fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in the rice and stir well to mix in the green onions throughout. Spread the rice all around the wok surface area and let the rice heat up, untouched until you hear the bottoms of the grains sizzle, about 1-2 minutes. Use the spatula to toss the rice, again spreading the rice out over the surface of wok.\r\n\r\n5 Drizzle the soy sauce all around the rice and toss. Add the peas and carrots, the cooked eggs, shrimp and sesame oil, tossing to mix the rice evenly with all of the ingredients. Let everything heat back up again, until the rice grains are so hot they practically dance! Taste and add an additional 1 teaspoon of soy sauce if needed.",

Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment.\r\n\r\n2) In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut, coconut cream, salt, and coconut flavor, stirring till thoroughly combined.\r\n\r\n3) Add the coconut milk powder, stirring to combine.\r\n\r\n4) Drop the sticky mixture in ping pong-sized balls (about 1 1/2\") onto the prepared baking sheets. It helps to use a tablespoon cookie scoop or small ice cream scoop here. For best results, pack the coconut mixture into the scoop; each ball should weigh about 1 ounce. You can space the balls fairly close together on the baking sheet; they only need about 3/4\" to 1\" between them.\r\n\r\n5) Bake the macaroons for about 10 minutes; they wont brown. You may see the merest hint of brown on top.\r\n\r\n6) Remove from the oven, and cool completely on the baking sheet.\r\n\r\n7) To make the coating, heat the chocolate chips, butter, and corn syrup until the chips are very soft. A microwave oven works well, as does a saucepan set over very low heat.\r\n\r\n8) Dip half of each cooled macaroon into the chocolate. Set the macaroons back on the baking sheet, and allow the chocolate to set completely before serving. To store, place in one layer in a closed container. Theyll keep for 2 or 3 days, but will gradually become less moist as they sit.\r\n\r\nYield: 33 macaroons.\r\n\r\ntips from our bakers\r\nCoconut cream, sweetened condensed coconut milk, is the coconut equivalent of sweetened condensed milk. Substitute sweetened condensed milk, if desired.\r\nCoconut milk powder adds flavor and helps the macaroons hold their nice, smooth shape. Leave it out if you like.",

        "instructions": "TO MAKE SHELL: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In mixer bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Beat in salt and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Add sugar, a tablespoon at a time, beating after each addition. Continue until very stiff peaks form. Fold in nuts and vanilla. Lightly butter a metal 8-inch pie plate. (Do NOT use glass.) Spoon meringue into pan lightly, building up the edges to come at least 1/2 inch above the side of the pan. Bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until light brown. Cool completely before adding filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Melt chocolate and water in a pan over hot, but not boiling, water, stirring occasionally, to blend. Add vanilla and chocolate mixture (cooled) to whipped cream and pile into meringue shell, swirling top with spatula. Be sure to cool the chocolate mixture before adding to the whipped cream. If it is too warm, the mixture will thin out. If this happens, chill until it is thick enough to put in shell.",
